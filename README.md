# Xylophone Sound App (SwiftUI)

This project is a neat usage of Apple's AVFoundation framework. 
When this porject is run, the user can play an instrument from their device. It was created using 
the iPad Pro and Swift Playgrounds. This really showcases just what the iPad Pro can do, 
building simple apps is not out of reach is you don't own a device that can run macOS or Xcode. 




## How It Was Built

- SwiftUI
- iPad Pro
- AVFoundation framework (for sound)
